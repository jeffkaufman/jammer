# Map an Axis 49 to a Wicki-Hayden layout

Run `make run` to build this software and run it.  It will look for a midi
device calling itself `AXIS-49 USB Keyboard` and will present a virtual midi
device called `jammer`.  If not all the keys work, try transposing up/down.

Doesn't support selfless mode (yet) because I haven't been able to get my unit
to do selfless.
